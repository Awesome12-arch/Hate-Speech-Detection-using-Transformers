# Hate-Speech-Detection-using-Transformers

We used Happy Transformer to implement a BERT model that has been fine-tuned to classify hate speech. Happy Transformer is a Python package built on top of Hugging Face's Transformer library to make it easier to use. We'll be accessing the model through Hugging Face's model distribution network. We'll also cover how to fine-tune your own custom hate-speech detection model, which can be of type BERT, ROBERTA, ALBERT or DISTILBERT.
